            <h1 class="reasonwhy">Choose Your Reason and Explain Why</h1>

            <div class="flex-container">
              <div id="reason1">Canada has been ranked as the most educated country in the world! With about 56% of the population having attended some form of post-secondary studies. 

                Education is a fundamental right in Canada and every Canadian has the right to an education. Canada’s free public school system and mandatory schooling laws ensure that every Canadian has access to basic education. In addition, Canada also provides greater access to post-secondary education than many other countries.
                
                Canada is an excellent choice for international students to come to study. Canadian schools offer a high quality of teaching and are often times more affordable than other popular study destinations, such as the US. Studying in Canada can also help international students apply for Canadian permanent residence.
                
                </div>
              <div id="reason2">Canada has taken a pro-immigration stance for many years to supplement its aging population and address labour demands. As a result, the Canadian government has set up many pathways to help newcomers immigrate to Canada. 

                One of the most popular immigration pathways is through Express Entry. It is free to enter the Express Entry pool, and doing so not only provides an opportunity to apply for Canadian immigration but also opens eligible candidates up to receive a nomination from a Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). Receiving a PNP 
                nomination greatly increases the chances to receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence. </div>
              <div id="reason3">Canada has long experienced labour shortages, which have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 Pandemic. Unemployment rates are at record lows. On the other hand, job vacancy rates are at record highs with Canada recently reporting nearly a million unfilled jobs. In fact, research shows that immigration 
                
                is crucial to filling job vacancies and addressing growing labour shortages.

                Labour market outcomes for recent immigrants have been improving substantially in recent years. According to Statistics Canada, the employment rate for recent immigrants has increased by 8 percentage points since the early 2010s, while the earnings among recent economic immigrants rose by 39% percent.
                
                As a country, we depend on immigration to maintain our population growth. The government values immigration for its ability to boost the economy and create jobs for Canadians.</div> 
              <div id="reason4">Canada has a much lower crime rate than most other countries in the world. It also and a much lower rate of gun violence than compared to the United States. In 2022, Gun crimes are three times higher in the United States than in Canada. 

                Canada consistently does well in global surveys on safety, progress, and quality of life. Canada is regularly ranked in the top 10 safest countries in the world as defined by the Global Peace Index.
                
                Canada also ranks #2 in the ranking of the safest country for LGBT tourists conducted in 2020 as per Statista’s report.</div>
